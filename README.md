# Generative AI and LLM Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and applications built while learning Generative AI and Large Language Model (LLM) development. These projects were created as part of the online course [Bootcamp: Generative Artificial Intelligence and LLM App Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/bootcamp-generative-artificial-intelligence-and-llm-app-development/) by Julio Colomer.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of LLM development:

1. **01-poetry-setup**: Initial setup and environment configuration using Poetry
2. **02-langchain-basics**: Introduction to LangChain fundamentals
3. **03-langchain-basics**: Continued exploration of LangChain basics
4. **04-langchain-basics**: Advanced LangChain concepts
5. **05-langchain-basics**: Further LangChain implementations
6. **06-langchain-level-1-apps**: First level of LangChain applications
7. **07-langchain-level-2-apps**: Intermediate LangChain applications
8. **08-langchain-level-3-apps**: Advanced LangChain applications
9. **09-multi-agent-llm-apps**: Multi-agent systems using LLMs
10. **10-coding-assistant-apps**: Applications focused on coding assistance

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management
- OpenAI API key (for projects using OpenAI models)
- Other API keys as required by specific projects

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genai-llm-engineering.git
cd genai-llm-engineering
```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:

```bash
cd 01-poetry-setup
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configurations
```

## Project Structure

Each project directory contains:

- Source code
- Configuration files
- README with specific instructions
- Requirements or dependencies

## Learning Path

This repository follows a progressive learning path:

1. Basic setup and environment configuration
2. LangChain fundamentals and concepts
3. Building increasingly complex applications
4. Multi-agent systems
5. Specialized coding assistant applications
